re: filetypes
with language file, should be go with a .mct for mailchimp template, both for html + txt versions
then language file can kick in? scope and such as well for the commands. the main thing would be

re: List all Campaigns/Switch from menu
(not sure here about the use case - 
  i guess you would make a project for the one client w/api key, 
  and then you could just switch among campaigns? 
  Look at making it more like git? checkout will switch and pull? 
  but i tend to stay away from destructive actions like that)

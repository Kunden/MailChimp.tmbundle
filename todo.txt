* Rename html.html to use index.html. i think that would make more sense. who works with html.html???
* video showing people how to make a macro to combine commmands
* cache result of listMergeVars for each campaign when switching, + add reload command
* better exit/error handlign

potential features

* could possibly also build up the popup for them with defaults as well?
* Replicate use sent, archived?
* locale
* campaignSendTest - trigger a send test to email addy. of course, would need to throw email addy into the config
* campaignReplicate could be cool
* update bundle - if user has git, and checked out a verion, update the bundle, preservig their changes - like get bundles, but independant - should be compatible.

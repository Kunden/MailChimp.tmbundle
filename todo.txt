* A Merge Vars cheat sheet/reference. we now have popup for list specific ones. could possibly also build up the popup for them with defaults as well?
* video showing people how to make a macro to combine commmands
  * ie: upload + preview archive version

potential features

* campaignSendTest - trigger a send test to email addy. of course, would need to throw email addy into the config
* campaignReplicate could be cool
* make a switch function based on apikeys? http://apidocs.mailchimp.com/1.3/apikeys.func.php
* update bundle - if user has git, and checked out a verion, update the bundle, preservig their changes - like get bundles, but independant - should be compatible.

* cache result of listMergeVars for each campaign when switching, + add reload command (still mulling over the best way for this - is it even frequent enough that we would need to cache it? What is the right point to cache it)

potential features

* video showing people how to make a macro to combine commmands (for me, power users will know how to do this, others won't care)
* could possibly also build up the popup for them with defaults as well?
* Replicate use sent, archived?
* locale
* update bundle - if user has git, and checked out a version, update the bundle, preserving their changes - like get bundles, but independant - should be compatible.

todo 

* cache result of listMergeVars for each campaign when switching, + add reload command
* change Template select prompt to display My Templates, Template Gallery, Start from Scratch for user,gallery,base respectively

potential features

* video showing people how to make a macro to combine commmands (for me, power users will know how to do this, others won't care)
* could possibly also build up the popup for them with defaults as well?
* Replicate use sent, archived?
* locale
* campaignSendTest - trigger a send test to email addy. of course, would need to throw email addy into the config
* campaignReplicate could be cool
* update bundle - if user has git, and checked out a verion, update the bundle, preservig their changes - like get bundles, but independant - should be compatible.
